Hello

Someone submitted an account request for {{ email }} at {{ nc_instance_name }}. 

We were not able to find an active membership in the {{ an_instance_name }} database. 

This may be because you are registered with the {{ an_instance_name }} with a different e-mail address, your membership is not current, or your membership does not provide access to {{ nc_instance_name }} (for example, your local party is not set correctly).

Check which e-mail address you recieve {{ an_instance_name }} e-mail on, and if different from {{ email }} please request access again.

Alternatively, please contact the {{ nc_instance_name }} administrator for further support.
